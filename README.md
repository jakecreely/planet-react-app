# Planets Fact Site

Front End Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io) provides the assets and the figma design files for this project. The implementation choices were up to me.

## User Requirements

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs

## Tools Used
- React
- React Router
- SASS
- Figma
- Git

## My approach
This was the first time I had approached a project with the necessary design files. I started by trying to directly translate the design to code, although this looked fine on paper. There were a number of responsiveness issues and so my main goal became understanding how to build responsive websites. This lead me to learn about the different units and how the design files can be used. I also used SASS for the first time which I was able to grasp and felt sped up development time. I still feel I need to get to grips with structuring scss files which will be one of my goals for my next project.

### What I learnt
Having the assets and design files to hand really helped to simulate a working project environment. My aim was to focus on developing this project and learning from it when it gets tough rather than moving onto another project. SASS and relative units in CSS were my main takeaways from this project, using both to implement responsiveness at different screen sizes. I used React as I wanted to continue using it for project although this project didn't use it much, states and react-router were nice to use.

### Next Steps
- Replace pixel units with relative units where possible
- Have images sizes related to the other planets on smaller screen sizes
- Restructure SASS files to a more readable manner (rather than one large file)
